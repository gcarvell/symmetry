In this experiment, you will see a grid of black and white circles appear briefly on the screen, followed by a blank grid. 


Each pattern contains 8 white circles and 8 black circles in some arrangement. 

The task is to reproduce the pattern you saw, by clicking on the circles in the blank grid to turn them black. 

You can ‘undo’ a selection by clicking on it again. 

Once you have selected 8 black circles for your response, click ‘submit’ to move on to the next pattern. 


You will receive feedback after each response. 


You should respond at whatever pace feels comfortable and natural for you.
